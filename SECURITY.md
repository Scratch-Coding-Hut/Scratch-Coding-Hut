# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it using the "Report Vulnerability" button on our [Security page](#). We take security very seriously and appreciate your effort to make our system safer for everyone.

> **WARNING:**  
> If you discover a security vulnerability, do not attempt to exploit it on any accounts other than your own. Unauthorized exploitation of security vulnerabilities is illegal and may result in severe penalties.

> **CAUTION:**  
> Refrain from reporting security vulnerabilities through the Issues tab. Public disclosure in that channel may alert malicious actors, thereby compromising the security of our community. Always use the designated reporting mechanism for vulnerabilities.

Thank you for helping us keep our community safe!
